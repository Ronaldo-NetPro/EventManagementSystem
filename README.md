/**
 * EventManagerGUI
 *
 * A Swing-based event management desktop tool that enables users to
 * add, load, search, delete, and clear events. Events are represented
 * by the EventClass and persisted in a simple CSV text file.
 *
 * UI built entirely with Swing components, following an event-driven
 * approach where each button triggers the appropriate action handler.
 * Provides form validation, file-based persistence, and dynamic display
 * of events with user-friendly dialogs and messages.
 *
 * Demonstrates a lightweight MVC pattern in a Java Swing application.
 
# Event Management System (Java Swing)

A simple yet functional **desktop application** built in Java using Swing.  
It allows users to **add**, **load**, **search**, **delete**, and **clear** eventsâ€”with each event stored in a CSV file. Clean UI, basic form validation, and robust feedback dialogs included!


## Key Features of the system

**Add Event**: Name, date (`yyyy-MM-dd`), category, and location  
**Save Events**: Appends events to `events.txt` file  
**Load Events**: Displays stored events in a read-only area  
**Search Events**: Find events by *name* or *category*, case-insensitive  
**Delete Events**: Remove an event by name (rewrites file)  
**Clear Form**: Reset input fields and display pane
